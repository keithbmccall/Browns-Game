# THOUGHTS
*What is the game about?
  *This is a NFL simulation based trivia game. Your job is to answer 16 trivia questions in an attempt to make the playoffs.
*What features did it include?
  *Features include the dynamic win conditions based on your overall record vs the record of the computer controlled teams.
*Were there any particular pain points or unsolved problems you had to manage? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)
  *My pain point was a function that manipulated a team's scoring logic based on the trivia question.
*Is there any other information you think might help us understand what you've built?
  *Think like playing a sports game in season mode and "simulating" the season. You control your team's destiny by answering trivia questions
*Technologies
  *jQuery
*My approach
  *Game foundation came about while playing with constructor functions over the break. I decided to go ahead with the idea once I realized I had an score algorithm in place already.
